# CarouselView Challenge

The CarouselView Challenge is aimed at using the new [CarouselView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/carouselview/) in the context of real-world apps.

_Note: Some functionality may not be (fully) implemented yet as of this time. We're working to make sure that it is, but we still want your feedback on what's available now!_

For more details, check out the [preview documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/carouselview/).

I explain this code in my [blog](https://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/c/working-with-carouselview-in-xamarin-forms/).
